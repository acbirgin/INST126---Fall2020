PROJECT 1
#Callable objects
First step was to define the function using the def calculate() - defines the entire operation, calls it back at the end of the code. Indentation in the next line entails *calculate* function.
Second callable objects is the *again* function - used at the end of the primart operation in case the user wants to make another calculation. 
#Primary Operation
Defined the operations accordingly with the input function *+* for addition, etc.
Defined 2 variables that represent the two numbers being added or subtracted and added float() function for decimal placement.
#Conditional Statements
Used If, Elif, Else format to emphasize primary operations.
